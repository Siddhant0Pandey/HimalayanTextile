          Historical Background
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For millennia, cotton has been cultivated and treasured across
          civilizations as a premium textile fiber. From ancient Indus Valley
          and Egypt to the Americas, cotton has transformed human societies and
          become the world's most widely used natural fiber.

              Cotton fiber is harvested from the protective cases (bolls) that
              surround the seeds of cotton plants. Traditionally, farmers would
              hand-pick the fluffy white fiber, clean it of seeds through a
              laborious process, and card it to align the fibers before
              spinning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The soft fibers were then spun into thread using spindles or
              spinning wheels and woven into lightweight, breathable cloth on
              various types of looms. The resulting fabric was naturally soft,
              absorbent, and comfortable against the skin â€” perfect for diverse
              climates and applications.
