          Historical Background
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Silk (produced primarily by the Bombyx mori silkworm) has been
          cultivated for over 5,000 years, with origins tracing back to ancient
          China where legend attributes its discovery to Empress Leizi. This
          precious fiber emerged as one of the world's most coveted luxuries,
          creating trade routes that connected East and West, most notably the
          historic Silk Road.

            <p className="mb-2">
              The production of silk begins with silkworms spinning cocoons made
              of a single continuous filament that can extend up to 1,500
              meters. These cocoons are carefully harvested, treated with hot
              water or steam to dissolve the natural gum (sericin) binding the
              threads, and then unwound to reveal the lustrous silk fibers.
              Several strands are twisted together to create stronger threads
              before being woven into fabric.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, the secrets of silk production were closely guarded
              by the Chinese for nearly 3,000 years, making it one of history's
              earliest industrial secrets. The knowledge eventually spread to
              Korea, Japan, India, and later to the Byzantine Empire and Europe,
              transforming economies and establishing silk as a symbol of
              wealth, power, and refinement across civilizations.

          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          Silk represents an extraordinary convergence of natural wonder and
          human ingenuityâ€”a fiber that has shaped trade routes, inspired
          artistic traditions, and connected cultures for millennia. As we
          balance luxury with sustainability in contemporary markets,
          responsibly-produced silk offers a compelling model: renewable,
          biodegradable, and inherently valuable through both its physical
          properties and cultural significance. The lustrous fiber that once
          connected East and West continues to bridge past and future,
          demonstrating that nature's most exquisite materials remain relevant
          even in our most technologically advanced era.
