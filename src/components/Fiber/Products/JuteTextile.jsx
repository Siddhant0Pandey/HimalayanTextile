          About Jute Fabric
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
          Known as the "Golden Fiber," jute has been cultivated for centuries
          and is one of the most affordable natural fibers in the world. Jute is
          predominantly grown in the fertile delta regions of Bangladesh and
          India, where the warm, humid climate provides ideal growing
          conditions. The resulting fabric is celebrated for its remarkable
          tensile strength, biodegradability, and versatility. Jute fibers are
          naturally lustrous, with a golden to brownish sheen, and are 100%
          biodegradable and recyclable. Environmentally, jute is exceptionally
          sustainable - it requires minimal fertilizers and pesticides, enriches
          the soil, absorbs CO2 rapidly, and releases oxygen during cultivation.
          One hectare of jute plants can absorb up to 15 tons of carbon dioxide
          while releasing 11 tons of oxygen. Traditionally used for sacking and
          packaging (burlap/hessian), modern applications have expanded to
          include home textiles, carpets, high-fashion accessories, composites,
          geotextiles, and even as a substitute for plastic and wood. The
          labor-intensive processing methods have remained largely unchanged for
          generations, preserving traditional skills while supporting rural
          economies in South Asia.
